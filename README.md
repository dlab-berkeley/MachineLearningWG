# Machine Learning Working Group, Fall 2018

We meet on alternating Wednesdays from 3-5pm at D-Lab (Barrows 356). We have no expectation of prior machine learning experience, and simply go through one algorithm a meeting, with about 30 minutes each in R & Python. We also incorporate lightning talks and other guest presentations throughout our meetings.

**Fall 2018 - unsupervised methods**  
  - Sept. 5: [Principal component analysis (PCA)](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/MachineLearningWG/tree/master/Fall2018/sep5-PCA)
  - Sept. 19: K-means clustering  
  - Oct. 3: Hierarchical clustering  
  - Oct. 17: Medoid partitioning  
  - Oct. 31: tSNE  
  - Nov. 14: UMAP  
  - Nov. 28: Latent class analysis 
  - Dec. 12: Lightning talks  

We are always looking for student/staff/faculty presenters. Please contact us if you are interested!
