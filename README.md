# Machine Learning Working Group Fall 2017

This semester's topic is neural networks for image processing! 

[Click to find out where neural networks might fit in the data science universe, by Swami Chandrasekaran](http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/becoming-a-data-scientist/)  

[Check out the Neural Network Zoo, by Fjodor Van Veen](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/)
